# Bayesian Multi-Objective Optimization

Multi-objective optimization is a powerful approach that leverages state-of-the-art methods developed by the operations research and modern engineering community. This technical write-up provides an in-depth explanation of the multi-objective optimizer used by the research team at Ardea Investment Management to investigate portfolio allocation for clients.

## Motivation

Traditional single-objective optimization techniques may not capture the complexities and trade-offs involved in real-world problems. 
Multi-objective optimization enables the exploration of multiple objectives simultaneously, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the problem at hand. Especially, the Bayesian version 
tends to find more solutions of the pareto frontier

## Key Features and Benefits
